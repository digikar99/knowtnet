# knowtnet
A serverless JAM-stack based implementation of [KnowTNet](https://knowtnet.com). By definition, therefore, accounts will be limited to the single device. This is both a learning project as well as to get a cost-free implementation of KnowTNet, in case the project fails to launch or be profitable. 

# To run

- See the [orm-definitions](orm-definitions.lisp) and [data](data/) directory for the data format.
- Run `run-me.lisp` as a script with a lisp implementation; tested with SBCL. Requires quicklisp installed and loaded. This generates the `index.html`, `about.html` and the `data` directory files.
