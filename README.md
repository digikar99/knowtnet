# knowtnet
A serverless JAM-stack based implementation of [KnowTNet](https://knowtnet.com). By definition, therefore, accounts will be limited to the single device. This is both a learning project as well as to get a cost-free implementation of KnowTNet, in case the project fails to launch or be profitable.
